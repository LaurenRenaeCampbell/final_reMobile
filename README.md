# final_reMobile

Welcome to reMobile!

As we are a group of students at Oregon State University, we have collectively experienced challenges with the university's official mobile application. We believe that the app's current design is difficult to navigate and lacks user-friendly features, leading to frustration and inefficiency. Recognizing the importance of an intuitive and accessible app for enhancing the overall student experience, we have embarked on a group project to redesign the Oregon State University App. By addressing the app's shortcomings and creating a more user-centric design, we aim to improve its usability and functionality, benefiting the entire university community. Our goal is to develop an app that streamlines essential services, provides easy access to information, and ultimately enhances the user experience for students, faculty, and staff.

For this reason, we present to you the nearly completed, redesigned OSU Mobile App that is available to everyone.

Our team is working hard to complete this application during the summer of 2023, but feel confident with what we currently have finished. Some lingering tasks include the transportation, food, and billing pages! Along with cleaning up the UI overall. To get a good look at what the final product will look like, refer to the FIGMA model link below.
